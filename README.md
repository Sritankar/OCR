# Installation:
To use MLTU in your own project, you can install it from PyPI:
```bash
pip install mltu
```
When running tutorials, it's necessary to install mltu for a specific tutorial, for example:
```bash
pip install mltu==0.1.3
```
Each tutorial has its own requirements.txt file for a specific mltu version. As this project progress, the newest versions may have breaking changes, so it's recommended to use the same version as in the tutorial.
